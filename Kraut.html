Kraut is the principal of St. Elmo's College. He is the lord of the Bryan family, which represents the three families.<br><br>

His academic performance was not outstanding when he was young, but after entering the institute, he showed his amazing academic potential. Before taking office as principal, Claude had submitted more than 40 papers on magical creature research that could be selected for the Royal Society's report, and was a great scholar known far and wide.<br><br>

He has made the study of magical creatures his life's work, and is also passionate about alchemy. Good at making potions, and often use potions to solve problems, such as strengthening the body, restoring the spirit and so on.<br><br>

He is very knowledgeable and loves to learn everything, and is happy to teach students knowledge and learning methods. However, he is also troubled by the fact that he only talks to others about his research and the topics are not casual enough.<br><br>

He is very kind to his students and cares about their families, asking them if they have any financial problems and helping them. Students never saw President Claude angry, but he would act quite agitated when his research and thesis manuscripts were damaged.<br><br>

As the youngest president in the history of the college, he was worried about being suppressed by the seniors, so he often worked late at night to make something happen. When he was physically and mentally exhausted, he would even faint when he was emotional.<br><br>

He has a unique insight into military warfare and is called the "military advisor" by Rebessa, and has the trust of Princess Gwyneth for his counsel.<br><br>

Kraut's brother became a sacrificial lamb in the struggle for the post of principal and left the family.<br><br>

Marriage will reveal his wife's hidden attributes.
