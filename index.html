      <center><H2>Lords Choice</H2>
		  <div class="homepage"><p title='storyline 1'>The daughter will enter the Knight Academy at the age of 12. The Knight Academy has three lords, each representing a different domain. Rebessa-Rollers represents combat, Gwineth-Claremont represents intercourse, and Kraut-Brain represents life. Joining one of the lords means achieving the "knight's goal"——Each goal will correspond to four levels of demand, which contains a large number of tasks, such as Rebessa is combat-related, Gwineth is the ball, performance, part-time jobs and other social-related, Kraut is farming, horse racing and other life-related. Complete the knight's goal can get a lot of money and prestige rewards. At the same time, the choice of the lord can affect the ending of the subsequent game~</p></div>

				<p title="storyline 2">In the game, there are apparently 8 characters who can romance, but in reality, there are far more than just these 8 characters! Players can choose to let their daughters get married to these characters, or they can choose to let their daughters be single. If the player wants his daughter to get married to a specific person, they need to let her brush up on her good sense with the person and it is also necessary to trigger a side plot between the two.</p>

				<center><h2>Hidden Storyline</h2></center>
				<p title="storyline 3">Throughout the game, players will occasionally encounter something unusual, which may well be a hint of a hidden storyline. But the line open conditions require players to play into specific conditions. The answer to the identity of the daughter, the real destination of the wife, and the reason why Rebessa is behaving strangely will all be answered in this hidden storyline.</p>
