            Gwyneth is the princess of the volcano country, the daughter of the king. She is a lord representing the royal side of the three families.<br>
            <br>
            As a princess, she hates the name of Her Highness and rarely acts like a noble. She has trouble trusting other people, but loves her brother very much. But has given up trying to completely restore her brother, only hope that he can grow up safely, happy life.<br>
            <br>
            Since he was young, he studied a lot of knowledge about politics and military affairs, and was actively involved in the governance of the volcano country, striving for the goal of being the heir to the royal family. When dealing with people, he also recommends political and military-related reading and asks his subordinates to improve their knowledge in this area. But underneath the skin of the Flower of the Highlands, she hides a friendly and curious princess: she likes to listen to Ruth's talk about commoners' topics and ask Ruth to bring some commoners' food to taste.<br>
            <br>
            She has set many unfulfilled missions and goals for herself, hoping that Ruth will help her find a way to lead the volcano country to a better future.<br>
            <br>
            Seems to have a surprisingly cute and shy side in a marital relationship.
